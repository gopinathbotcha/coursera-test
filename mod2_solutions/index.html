            <h3>Espresso</h3>

          </div>

          <p>
            Espresso is a concentrated form of coffee served in small, strong shots and is the base for many coffee drinks. It's made from the same beans as coffee but is stronger, thicker, and higher in caffeine. However, because espresso is typically served in smaller servings than coffee, it has less caffeine per serving.

        <p>
          Definition. Outside of Italy, cappuccino is a coffee drink that today is typically composed of a single espresso shot and hot milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk. ...

        <h3>Latte</h3>

      </div>

      <p>
        A latte is a coffee drink that is normally made with espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. A cappuccino is very similar, but it has a greater percentage of foamed milk to steamed milk. ... Cafe au lait has only warm steamed milk added to coffee (sometimes espresso) and no foam.
